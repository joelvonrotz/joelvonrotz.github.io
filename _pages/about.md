Hey, I'm Joel

This blog here is just me sometimes writing about stuff. It's not really a definitive focus, but I do enjoy writing something once in a while.

Besides keeping this website alive, I also read some books (I'm not a book worm, but I sometimes have those needs to read, which is a really awesome thing, to be honest) and when time and the desire allows it I also take photos & sew some bags or small accessories.
Besides those things I'm always up for bouldering.
