I'm an electrical engineering student!

This website is not very active and I mostly write just when I feel like. The most active page is my projects page, which not only contains my summaries, but also some bike touring reports (if there are some going to come).

<div class="box-collection">

{% box(image="/images/projects/Flag_of_Japan.svg"
       title="Japan 2025"
       link1="/projects/japan-2025/"
       desc1="Read Journals") %}
  Hello, or more _Konichiwa_? Anyway, from April until July, I'll be discovering this country alone on my touring bike!
{% end %}
