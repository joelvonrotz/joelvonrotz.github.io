I'm an electrical engineering student!

This website is not very active and I mostly write just when I feel like. The most active page is my projects page, which not only contains my summaries, but also some bike touring reports (if there are some going to come).

## Links

{{ button (text="Downloads" link="/downloads") }} – Here you can find some stuff to download, for now being just my summaries

{{ button (text="Github" link="https://github.com/joelvonrotz") }} – Link to my Github profile
