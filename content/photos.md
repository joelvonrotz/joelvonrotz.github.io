Not sure how to do this, might think up of something. For now you can check out my flickr profile: {{ button (text="Flickr" link="https://www.flickr.com/photos/joelvonrotz") }}

All images done by me (on this website, on Flickr and any other platform) are generally free for non-commercial use (with the respective credit giving/attribution to me). Non-commercial can also be just your new desktop or phone wallpaper :)

If you intend to use any images for commercial use, please hit me up with a message (contact <\a> joelvonrotz.ch) to negotiate a price and wherever the business's values align with mine.

While I do these photos in my free time, I still hold a lot of value for them.
