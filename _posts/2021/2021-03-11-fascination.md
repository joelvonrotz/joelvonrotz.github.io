During the pandemic I've been able to collect a lot of information about myself and well, the lack of myself (as in who I want to see myself as). I was forced to learn about myself. In for this comes *fascination* & *curiosity* and the ability to simply show it.

## What is this about?

This post actually happened, because I was talking with a very close friend about life & stuff yesterday. It gave me a more clear mind and how to approach things better, most importantly it reminded me of being interested in something. 

I don't mean that I completely forgot how to be interested in something, I mean that showing interest and fascination could lead to some really good conversations.

## Superpowers, that I'm also learning

Have you ever met someone who is very obsessed over something, like surfing or downhill mountain biking? You notice how much they can talk about that subject and when you ask a question, for example what kind of surfboard do I need to start surfing, they almost explode with answers. I love these people, they have such passion for their thing and they just enjoy every crook and cranny of their hobby.

Being fascinated (& interested) helps me connect with other people. It forces me to open up and just explain to the other person, why exactly it interests me. Explaining to someone why exactly you are interest in person X or thing Y, helps a lot more than just saying "I'm interested". It has more impact and maybe it gets the other person to open up too.

## Where I'm going üêù

With this post written, I'll take my next steps and learn about bees. I don't know why but I love these tiny creatures. They have such an important task of keeping the cycle of nature going and their existence alone is an important indicator of every other creatures life.

Since my home canton has a small beekeeping place, I have a convenient way to learn about bees and what it takes to learn beekeeping.

Write ya later!
