In this post I'll talk about self-fulfillment (& self-confidence). To those, that read this post, please be aware, that the content here is only my thoughts, no research or whatsoever has been done on it. It's a thing I want to try out: turn my thoughts into written text, which might help me deal with them.

The reason I wrote this post, is because of a [reddit-post](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/jpqv9a/im_quitting_video_games_help/) I've recently read, which made me think about the subject "self-fulfillment".

Self-fulfillment (& self-confidence) is something I've been struggling with for a long time (and I'd say is still going). After stepping into the work-life as an electronics technician apprentice, my self-confidence has been falling apart slowly, due to me comparing myself with people, that have been doing this area of expertise for a lot longer. As a result, I've started to criticize my accomplishments more and more, to the point that I've stopped working on various side-projects (that I've created for simply learning new things), simply because I see myself as a dumb person, that can't solve a specific problem.

Starting a learn-project and seeing already finished products, that could easily replace my project, on the internet feels soul-crushing, which is the reason why I sometimes stop and delete my projects. The reason behind that ironic problem is, that I see someone, that has created a more robust system than me, as superior and that I shouldn't tread on "his" kingdom. This kind of view stops me in every way possible. Looking at it more literally I shouldn't even be allowed to walk, because there are other people on the world that can walk miles better than me. So what keeps me walking?

Walking of course is an action needed for survival. If I'm not allowed to walk anywhere, I'm not able to find any food and as a followup I starve to death. Side-projects on the other hand aren't necessary for survival, but they are necessary for education!

I'm so glad, that I've finally taken the courage to write this up, it feels great! I am a young adult, but I imagine, this is the process I have to do to get to know myself better. I can read the posts of a past Joel and reflect on it &rarr; What has changed since then?

To those that have read this post, thank you and I hope you liked it. Feedback is always great to hear and might help me a lot!
